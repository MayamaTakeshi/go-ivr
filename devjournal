This is the first go app that I've ever written so this is what I did so far:

1) installed go:
  cd tmp
  wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.14.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz
  tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.14.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz
  vim /etc/profile
  # add this line:
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
  . /etc/profile

2) created the new repo as https://github.com/MayamaTakeshi/go-ivr

3) cloned the repo locally and cd to folder
  git clone https://MayamaTakeshi@github.com/MayamaTakeshi/go-ivr
  cd go-ivr

4) called 'go mod init' (this created go.mod):
  go mod init github.com/MayamaTakeshi/go-ivr

5) added goesl (go.mod was updated with dependencies):
  go get github.com/0x19/goesl

Restarting this project today.
Nowadays, there is no special configuration to use go.
We will use asdf to manage golang versions.


I was planning to use 
  https://github.com/sbabiv/xml2map
to convert XML to a generic map structure.
However, now I think this cannot be done as a map would lose ordering.
What we actually want is to have map for attributes of each element. But the elements themselves must be list items that might contain children.


Searching further, I think we should use
  https://github.com/eliben/gosax
as it will simplify preparing XML schema validation.
